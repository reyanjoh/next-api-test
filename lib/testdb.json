            "bio": "Hi, I`m Michael and I received my Bachelor of Science in Health Sciences and a Minor in Psychology from Saint Louis University. I received my Doctorate of Physical Therapy from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Throughout my life, I have always enjoyed helping out others and connecting with people of all different walks of life. I was introduced to the world of physical therapy through many close family member experiences. Through their journeys, I became fascinated by the field of physical therapy and how impactful this field can be on improving an indivual`s quality of life and physical health. For me, my passion for healthcare and physical therapy allows me to make a difference in patients` lives through the use of movement and education as medicine. Areas of expertise I would like to work towards in the future include balance/vestibular rehabilitation and Parkinson`s disease. I would like to gain certifications pertaining to these areas to improve my knowledge such as LSVT BIG certified and FYZICAL balance certified.",

            "bio": "I have lived all my life in the best city, Chicago, and plan on never moving. I graduated from Robert Morris University, which is now Roosevelt University. I have played soccer the majority of my life and it has had a huge impact on who I am today. I tore my meniscus when I was playing high school soccer, and that`s where the development of love for physical therapy came into play. Being the main translator for my Spanish speaking parents and grandparents during doctor`s appointments, I have been able to experience the limited number of Spanish speaking workers in health care. This, all tied together with my love for sports, became the reasoning as to why I wanted to work in health care. I chose physical therapy because experiencing it first-hand myself, I enjoyed the attention to detail to patient care. I enjoy helping others and giving them a reason to smile again when most of their hope is down.",
